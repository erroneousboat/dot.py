# TODO

- [x] setup circleci

- [ ] let circleci create distribution file

- [ ] finish todo tests

- [ ] add command dot push that will push the new changes to the git repository

- [ ] dot init might as well create a git repo if none is present

- [ ] dot add should also issue the dot command, adding a file will always
      result in a symlinking of these files

- [ ] change README.rst to README.md
